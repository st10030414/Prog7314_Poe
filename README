Option 1: Clone with Git
If Git is installed on your system, open a terminal and run the clone command available on the repository’s main page. Cloning ensures your local copy remains linked to the remote repository, allowing you to easily retrieve future updates using Git commands.

Option 2: Download as a ZIP
If you prefer not to use Git, select the green Code button on the repository page and choose Download ZIP. After the download completes, extract the contents of the archive to your preferred location on your computer.
