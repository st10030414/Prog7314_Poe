We used AI to translate the app’s user-facing text into multiple languages to support accessibility and international use.



🛠 How the App Was Prepared for Play Store Publishing
The app is fully structured to meet Google Play Console requirements.

1. 	Unique Application ID (com.example.prog7314_poe)
2.	Versioning, implemented inside buildgradle (versionCode 1, versionName "1.0")
	These are required for Play Store uploads and future updates.
3.	Signing Configurations. A release keystore was generated and configured: app → Build → Generate Signed App Bundle
4.	App Bundle Generation (AAB):
	Steps followed:
	Go to
	Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK
	Select Android App Bundle (.aab)
	Choose the keystore (created earlier)
	Generate the signed Play Store–ready bundle
